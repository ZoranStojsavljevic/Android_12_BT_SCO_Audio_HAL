## How to integrate bluetooth driver service with HAL & AIDL on Android 12?

Integrating a Bluetooth driver service with Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) and Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) in
Android 12 involves several steps. This process typically
includes developing a HAL, defining an AIDL interface, and
creating a system service that communicates with both.

Hereâ€™s a general guide to achieving this.

### 1. Create a Bluetooth HAL Implementation

#### Define the HAL Interface

First, you need to define the Bluetooth HAL interface in the
hardware/interfaces/bluetooth/ directory. This is where you'll
specify the functions that the HAL will expose to the Android
framework.

Android uses HIDL (HAL Interface Definition Language) or AIDL
(Android Interface Definition Language) for newer versions.
In Android 12, HIDL is still supported, but AIDL is preferred
for new HALs.

Create an AIDL file for Bluetooth in a directory like
hardware/interfaces/bluetooth/aidl/IBluetoothHal.aidl .

Example:

	aidl code

```
package android.hardware.bluetooth;

interface IBluetoothHal {
	void enableBluetooth();
	void disableBluetooth();
	boolean isBluetoothEnabled();
}
```

#### Implement the HAL

Implement the HAL interface in C/C++ (for HIDL) or Java (for
AIDL). This will involve writing the logic to communicate
with the Bluetooth hardware.

The HAL implementation should handle all low-level interactions
with the Bluetooth driver and hardware.

Example (AIDL-based HAL implementation in C++):

	cpp code

```
#include "BluetoothHal.h"

namespace android::hardware::bluetooth::aidl {

	void BluetoothHal::enableBluetooth() {
		// Code to enable Bluetooth hardware
	}

	void BluetoothHal::disableBluetooth() {
		// Code to disable Bluetooth hardware
	}

	bool BluetoothHal::isBluetoothEnabled() {
		// Return Bluetooth status
	}

} // namespace android::hardware::bluetooth::aidl
```

### 2. Define an AIDL Interface for System Service

The system service will interact with the Bluetooth HAL via the
AIDL interface. Define an AIDL interface for your Bluetooth
system service that will be used by the Android framework or
apps to communicate with the Bluetooth HAL.

Place the AIDL file in a package like
android/bluetooth/IBluetoothService.aidl.

Example:

	aidl code
```
package android.bluetooth;

interface IBluetoothService {
	void enableBluetooth();
	void disableBluetooth();
	boolean isBluetoothEnabled();
}
```

### 3. Implement the Bluetooth System Service

#### Create a system service that implements the AIDL interface

This service will communicate with the HAL and provide Bluetooth
functionalities to the framework and apps.

The service implementation is typically done in Java/Kotlin and
resides in the frameworks/base/ directory.

Example:

	java code
```
public class BluetoothService extends IBluetoothService.Stub {

	private final IBluetoothHal mBluetoothHal;

	public BluetoothService(IBluetoothHal bluetoothHal) {
		mBluetoothHal = bluetoothHal;
	}

	@Override
	public void enableBluetooth() {
		mBluetoothHal.enableBluetooth();
	}

	@Override
	public void disableBluetooth() {
		mBluetoothHal.disableBluetooth();
	}

	@Override
	public boolean isBluetoothEnabled() {
		return mBluetoothHal.isBluetoothEnabled();
	}
}
```

#### Register the Service

Register your service in the SystemServer class, which is part
of Android's boot sequence. Add your service initialization
code there.

Example (in SystemServer.java):

	java code
```
private void startBluetoothService() {
	IBluetoothHal bluetoothHal = new BluetoothHalImpl(); // HAL implementation
	BluetoothService bluetoothService = new BluetoothService(bluetoothHal);
	ServiceManager.addService(Context.BLUETOOTH_SERVICE, bluetoothService);
}
```

### 4. Modify the Android Build System

Ensure that your HAL implementation and system service are
included in the Android build. Modify the Android.mk or
Android.bp files accordingly.

Add your HAL to the PRODUCT_PACKAGES in the device-specific
build configuration.

Example (Android.bp):

	bp (blueprint) code
```
aidl_interface {
	name: "android.hardware.bluetooth",
	srcs: ["IBluetoothHal.aidl"],
}

cc_library_shared {
	name: "libbluetoothhal",
	srcs: ["BluetoothHal.cpp"],
	shared_libs: ["libhardware"],
}
```

### 5. Permissions and SELinux Policy

Ensure that your service and HAL have the necessary permissions
to access the Bluetooth hardware.

Modify the SELinux policies to allow the service and HAL to
interact with the hardware and other system components securely.

Example (SELinux policy .te file):

	allow bluetooth_service bluetooth_device:chr_file rw_file_perms;

### 6. Testing

Build and flash the Android image onto your device.

Test the integration by interacting with the Bluetooth
functionality from both the Android framework and apps. Verify
that your service properly communicates with the HAL and
controls the Bluetooth hardware.

### Summary

#### HAL Definition and Implementation

Use AIDL/HIDL to define the Bluetooth HAL interface. Implement
the HAL in C++/Java.

#### System Service

Define a system service interface in AIDL. Implement the system
service to interact with the HAL.

#### Build and Permissions

Modify build files and SELinux policies. Register and start the
service in the SystemServer.

#### Testing and Debugging

Flash and test the functionality on the device.

This is a high-level overview of the process, and specific
details may vary based on the exact requirements of your
Bluetooth hardware and the Android device you are working on.

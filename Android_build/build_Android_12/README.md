## Fetching and compiling the entire Android 12 source code

Fetching and compiling the entire Android 12 source code
requires a well-prepared environment and understanding of
the build process.

Below is a professional and comprehensive guide:

### 1. Prerequisites

#### System Requirements

	- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04+ (recommended) or macOS (Linux
	  is preferred for compatibility).

	- Hardware:

	    Disk Space: At least 250GB (more if building for multiple targets).

	    RAM: 16GB minimum (32GB or more recommended).

	    CPU: Multi-core processor (4 cores minimum, 8+ recommended).

#### Install Required Packages

	Run the following commands to install essential dependencies:

	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk git-core gnupg flex bison build-essential \
	  zip curl zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev \
	  x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc \
	  unzip fontconfig python-is-python3 libncurses5

#### [OPTIONAL] Install Repo Tool (if does not exist)

If there is no ~/bin/repo tool installed, the next steps must be
performed!

The repo tool is used to manage the Android source tree:

	$ mkdir -p ~/bin
	$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
	$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
	$ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

#### Set Java Environment

Ensure Java is set to OpenJDK 11:

	$ sudo update-alternatives --config java

Make sure the Java environment is set correctly by running:

	$ java -version

### 2. Download the Android 12 Source Code

#### 1. Create a Directory for the Source Code:

	$ mkdir -p ~/android/12
	$ cd ~/android/12

#### 2. Initialize the Repo

Use the following command to initialize the source tree for Android 12:

	$ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-12.0.0_r1

#### 3. Sync the Repo

Download the entire source code (~100GB+):

	$ repo sync -j$(nproc)

Add --no-clone-bundle if facing shallow clone issues:

	$ repo sync -j$(nproc) --no-clone-bundle

### 3. Configure the Build Environment

#### 1. Set Up the Build Environment

From the root of the Android source tree:

	$ source build/envsetup.sh

#### 2. Select a Build Target

Use the lunch command to choose the target device and build variant:

	$ lunch <target_product>-<build_variant>

Example for a generic ARM64 device:

	$ lunch aosp_arm64-eng

Common build variants:

	user: Optimized for production (secure, no debug tools).

	userdebug: Debuggable version of user (for testing and debugging).

	eng: Full debugging features enabled (for development).

### 4. Build the Entire Android 12 System

#### 1. Start the Build: To build the entire system:

	$ make -j$(nproc)

	  -j$(nproc) utilizes all available CPU cores for faster
	    compilation.

	  Alternatively, use:

	    $ m

	    This is shorthand for the same build command.

#### 2. [OPTIONAL] to build specific components

To build only the system image:

	$ make systemimage

To build the boot image:

	$ make bootimage

#### 3. Monitor Build Progress

	The build process can take 1-12 hours or more, depending on the
	  hardware used.

	Output files will be generated in the out/target/product/<device>
	  directory.

### 5. Flash the Built System

#### 1. Prepare the Target Device:

	Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on the device.

	Boot the device into fastboot mode (power + volume down key
	  for most devices).

#### 2. Connect to the Computer: Verify the device connection:

	$ fastboot devices

#### 3. Flash the Build: Use the flashall script to flash all images:

	$ fastboot flashall

	Ensure the target device's bootloader is unlocked.

#### 4. Reboot the Device:

	$ fastboot reboot

### 6. Verify the Build

#### 1. Boot the Device

	After flashing, the device should boot into the freshly compiled
	  Android 12 system.

#### 2. Test Functionality

	Check the features and ensure there are no boot loops or errors.

### 7. Debugging Build Issues

#### 1. Clean Build Environment

If the build fails due to previous configurations:

	$ make clean

#### 2. Verbose Build Output

	For detailed error logs:

	$ make -j$(nproc) showcommands

#### 3. Check Missing Dependencies

	Ensure all libraries and tools are correctly installed.

### 8. Optimize for Incremental Builds

After the initial build, subsequent builds can be sped up by
recompiling only changes:

	$ make installclean
	$ make -j$(nproc)

### 9. Professional Tips

	- Disk Space Management

	  Periodically clean up old builds or use an SSD for faster
	    performance.

	- Use ccache

	  Enable ccache to speed up repeated builds:

	  $ export USE_CCACHE=1
	  $ ccache -M 100G

	- Automate with Scripts

	  Create a script to set up and run the build process for
	    consistency.

### 10. Output Files

	Key output files are in out/target/product/<device>:

	  system.img: System partition image.

	  boot.img: Bootloader image.

	  userdata.img: User data partition image.

By following this process, the entire Android 12 source can be
built professionally and efficiently.
